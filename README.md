Subject: Request for extension of the deadline for the project

Dear Internal Success Team,

I am writing to request an extension of time to complete the given task. 
For the last two days, a family emergency has arisen at my home. I am not in a condition to work. 
Hence, I was unable to complete my task these days. 
The original due date for submission is February 5, 2023. I regret that I will not be able to complete the assignment on time. 
Hence I request you to kindly grant me an extension of 3 days. I assure you that I will complete the task by February 8, 2023. 


I thank you for your kindness and consideration of this request. 
Please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience

Sincerely,
Anil Patel
